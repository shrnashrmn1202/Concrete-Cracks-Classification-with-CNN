# Cracks-Classification-with-CNN

## Identifying Cracks on Concrete with Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network model is created to identify cracks on concrete with high accuracy. 
The problem is modelled as a binary classification problem: no cracks (negative) and cracks (positive). The model is trained with a dataset of 40000 images (20000 images of concrete in good condition and 20000 images of concrete with cracks).
